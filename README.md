# Computer Vision RPS

MILESTONE 1

using googles teachable machine, i have created an ML model for my computer to detect the difference between rock, paper and scissors
this will be used later on to create a live RPS game where i can use my camera to input my choice instead of using a CLI or GUI
this model can then be exported as a .h5 file and .txt to allow python to manage and use the model created

MILESTONE 2
I have downloaded my model from the goog teachable machine website. this included the labels.txt that contained the four different options. rock, paper, scissors or no readable data.
i have then used a program to quickly test my model if it works
